## The Knowledge Lifecycle

### Overview

Knowledge, like any organizational asset, has a lifecycle from creation to retirement. Effective lifecycle management ensures knowledge remains accurate, relevant, and valuable throughout its existence.

### Lifecycle Phases

```
     CREATE → CAPTURE → ORGANIZE → SHARE → USE → MAINTAIN → RETIRE
