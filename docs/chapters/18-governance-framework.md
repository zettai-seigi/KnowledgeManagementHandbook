# Chapter 18: Knowledge Governance Framework

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Design and implement a comprehensive Knowledge Management governance framework
- Establish effective governance structures including steering committees and working groups
- Define decision rights and accountability at all organizational levels
- Create escalation paths for knowledge-related issues and decisions

## What is Knowledge Governance?

**Knowledge Governance** is the system of decision-making, accountability, and control mechanisms that ensure Knowledge Management activities align with organizational objectives, maintain quality standards, and deliver measurable value.

### Formal Definition

> Knowledge Governance encompasses the frameworks, structures, policies, roles, and processes that guide decision-making, ensure accountability, maintain quality, and drive continuous improvement in organizational knowledge management practices.

### Governance vs. Management

| Aspect | Governance | Management |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Focus** | What, why, and who decides | How and when execution happens |
| **Time Horizon** | Strategic, long-term | Tactical, operational |
| **Authority** | Decision rights, accountability | Implementation, delivery |
| **Activities** | Policy setting, oversight, compliance | Process execution, daily operations |
| **Participants** | Executives, steering committees | Managers, practitioners, contributors |
