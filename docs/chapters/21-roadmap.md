# Chapter 21: Implementation Roadmap

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Develop a phased implementation roadmap for knowledge management
- Identify and execute quick wins to demonstrate early value
- Design and execute pilot programs effectively
- Apply change management principles to KM implementation
- Engage stakeholders throughout the implementation journey
- Define success criteria and measure progress

---

## The Phased Implementation Approach

### Why Phased Implementation?

| Approach | Pros | Cons | When to Use |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Big Bang** | Fast deployment, single cutover | High risk, difficult rollback | Small organizations, simple KM |
| **Phased** | Lower risk, learning opportunity | Longer timeline, complexity | Most organizations (recommended) |
| **Parallel** | Safe transition, fallback option | Resource intensive, confusion | Mission-critical systems |

**Recommendation:** Phased implementation provides the best balance of risk management and value delivery for most KM initiatives.

### The Three-Phase Model

```
Phase 1: Foundation           Phase 2: Expansion          Phase 3: Optimization
(Months 1-6)                  (Months 7-18)               (Months 19-36)
     ↓                              ↓                            ↓
Pilot + Prove Value     →    Scale + Integrate      →    Mature + Optimize
```
