## Introduction

Knowledge capture and creation form the foundation of any knowledge management program. Without effective mechanisms to capture existing knowledge and create new knowledge assets, even the most sophisticated knowledge management systems and strategies will have little value. This chapter explores the methods, techniques, and practices that enable organizations to systematically capture knowledge from experts, processes, and experiences, and to create high-quality knowledge assets that serve organizational needs.

Knowledge capture is not simply about recording information. It involves eliciting expertise, organizing insights, documenting context, and creating knowledge assets that others can understand and apply. Effective knowledge capture requires understanding what knowledge is valuable, when and how to capture it, and how to do so in ways that maintain quality while minimizing burden on contributors.

At the heart of effective knowledge capture lies the **SECI model's Externalization mode** - the critical process of converting tacit knowledge (expertise in people's heads) into explicit knowledge (documented, shareable assets). This chapter focuses primarily on Externalization techniques, while Chapter 10 explores the full spectrum of knowledge conversion modes.

## The Knowledge Capture Challenge

### Why Knowledge Capture Is Difficult

Organizations face several fundamental challenges in capturing knowledge:

**Tacit Nature of Expertise**: Much valuable knowledge exists as tacit expertise - patterns, insights, and judgment that experts apply unconsciously without explicit awareness. Experts often don't know what they know or find it difficult to articulate their expertise.

**Time and Resource Constraints**: Knowledge capture requires time from busy experts and subject matter specialists. Creating high-quality documentation competes with operational priorities and billable work.

**Motivation and Incentives**: Without clear benefits or incentives, individuals may not prioritize knowledge sharing. Some may fear that sharing knowledge reduces their value or competitive advantage.

**Quality and Usability**: Captured knowledge must be accurate, complete, well-organized, and usable by the intended audience. Poor quality knowledge assets create more confusion than value.

**Knowledge Decay**: Knowledge becomes outdated as processes, technology, and context change. Keeping knowledge current requires ongoing effort and commitment.

### Strategic Approach to Knowledge Capture

Effective knowledge capture requires a strategic approach:

| Strategic Element | Description | Key Considerations |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Prioritization** | Focus on high-value knowledge gaps and risks | Critical processes, retiring experts, repeated questions, error-prone areas |
| **Integration** | Embed capture in existing workflows and processes | After-action reviews, project closeouts, ticket resolution, onboarding |
| **Standardization** | Use consistent formats, templates, and quality criteria | Article templates, style guides, metadata standards, review criteria |
| **Facilitation** | Provide support and tools that make capture easier | Knowledge brokers, writing support, capture tools, structured interviews |
| **Recognition** | Acknowledge and reward knowledge contribution | Attribution, performance metrics, gamification, leadership recognition |
| **Governance** | Establish roles, responsibilities, and quality processes | Content owners, reviewers, approval workflows, retirement policies |

## Knowledge Capture Methods

### Just-in-Time Capture

Capturing knowledge at the point of use or creation minimizes disruption and maximizes relevance:

**After-Action Reviews (AARs)**: Structured reflection immediately following an event, project, or incident to capture lessons learned while details are fresh.

**Ticket Resolution Documentation**: Capturing solutions and troubleshooting steps when resolving support tickets or service requests.

**Problem Resolution Records**: Documenting root cause analysis and solutions when solving complex problems.

**Exit Interviews and Knowledge Transitions**: Systematically capturing knowledge from employees who are leaving or changing roles.

**Project Closeout Sessions**: Structured knowledge capture at project completion, documenting decisions, lessons, and reusable artifacts.

**Peer Assists**: Bringing together experts before starting a new initiative to capture and transfer relevant experience.

### Planned Knowledge Capture

Proactive, scheduled capture of critical knowledge:

**Expert Interviews**: Structured or semi-structured interviews with subject matter experts to elicit and document their expertise.

**Documentation Sprints**: Dedicated time blocks focused on creating or updating knowledge documentation.

**Knowledge Audits**: Systematic identification of knowledge gaps followed by targeted capture efforts.

**Observation and Job Shadowing**: Watching experts perform tasks to identify tacit knowledge and undocumented procedures.

**Workshops and Group Sessions**: Facilitated sessions where teams collaboratively document processes, lessons, or best practices.

### Automated and Passive Capture

Leveraging technology to capture knowledge with minimal manual effort:

**Activity Monitoring**: Capturing patterns from system logs, search queries, and user behavior to identify knowledge needs.

**Collaboration Analytics**: Mining emails, chat transcripts, and collaboration tools for frequently discussed topics and emerging issues.

**Content Recommendation**: Using AI to identify experts, related content, and potential knowledge assets based on user activity.

**Process Mining**: Analyzing workflow and transaction data to document actual processes and identify variations.

### After-Action Review (AAR) Method

AARs are structured reflection processes that capture lessons immediately following events. They originated in military operations and are now widely used in healthcare, emergency response, project management, and IT operations.

**Standard AAR Structure**:

1. **What was supposed to happen?** (The plan/expectation)
2. **What actually happened?** (Objective facts)
3. **Why was there a difference?** (Root causes)
4. **What should we do next time?** (Lessons and actions)

**AAR Facilitation Best Practices**:

- Conduct within 24-48 hours while memories are fresh
- Include all key participants, not just leaders
- Create psychologically safe environment
- Focus on learning, not blame
- Document lessons and action items
- Assign ownership for improvements
- Follow up on action items

**AAR Documentation Template**:

### Knowledge Elicitation Techniques

**Critical Incident Technique**:

Ask experts to describe specific situations where their expertise made a difference, then probe for decision-making process, alternatives considered, and reasoning.

*Sample Questions*:
- "Tell me about a time when troubleshooting this system was particularly challenging."
- "What made that situation different from normal cases?"
- "What did you consider when choosing your approach?"
- "What signals or symptoms did you rely on?"

**Think-Aloud Protocol**:

Expert verbalizes their thinking while performing a task or solving a problem, exposing internal reasoning and decision processes.

*Implementation*:
1. Brief expert on think-aloud technique
2. Start with practice task
3. Remind expert to keep talking
4. Record session for later analysis
5. Minimize interruptions during performance
6. Follow up with clarifying questions

**Scenario-Based Elicitation**:

Present hypothetical or past scenarios and ask expert to explain how they would respond, revealing conditional knowledge and judgment.

*Scenario Types*:
- Normal operations: "How do you handle X situation?"
- Exceptions: "What if Y occurs during the process?"
- Multiple failures: "If both A and B fail, what's your approach?"
- Conflicting priorities: "When you must choose between P and Q, what factors guide your decision?"

**Repertory Grid Technique**:

Structured method to elicit how experts differentiate and categorize elements in their domain.

*Process*:
1. Identify elements (systems, problems, approaches)
2. Present triads of elements
3. Ask: "How are two similar and different from the third?"
4. Record constructs (dimensions of difference)
5. Rate all elements on all constructs
6. Analyze patterns in expert's mental model

### Crowdsourcing Knowledge

## Expert Knowledge Capture

Expert knowledge, particularly tacit expertise developed over years of experience, represents some of an organization's most valuable and vulnerable assets. Capturing this knowledge requires specialized approaches.

### Tacit Knowledge Elicitation Techniques

Tacit knowledge is difficult to articulate because experts often don't consciously think about their expertise - it has become automatic through practice.

**Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA)**:

Systematic approach to understanding complex cognitive work:

*Steps*:
1. **Task Identification**: Define the cognitive task to analyze
2. **Knowledge Audit**: Identify what expert knows and does
3. **Knowledge Elicitation**: Use multiple techniques to extract knowledge
4. **Analysis and Representation**: Structure and organize knowledge
5. **Validation**: Verify with expert and other users
6. **Documentation**: Create usable knowledge artifacts

*CTA Methods*:
- **Goal Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into goals and sub-goals
- **Decision Laddering**: Explore decision criteria and reasoning
- **Concept Mapping**: Visualize relationships between concepts
- **Simulation Interview**: Walk through scenarios and cases
- **Critical Decision Method**: Analyze challenging real-world incidents

**Laddering Technique**:

Probe upward (why) and downward (how) to uncover reasoning and details:

*Upward Laddering* (Understanding Why):
- "Why is that important?"
- "What does that tell you?"
- "Why do you check that first?"

*Downward Laddering* (Understanding How):
- "How do you do that?"
- "What specifically do you look for?"
- "What are the steps involved?"

*Example Exchange*:
- Expert: "I check the system logs first."
- Interviewer: "Why do you check the logs first?" (up)
- Expert: "Because they show the sequence of events."
- Interviewer: "What does the sequence tell you?" (up)
- Expert: "Whether it's a cause or symptom."
- Interviewer: "How do you distinguish cause from symptom?" (down)
- Expert: "I look for the first unusual entry that breaks the expected pattern."
- Interviewer: "What specifically makes an entry unusual?" (down)

**Pattern Recognition Elicitation**:

Experts recognize patterns that novices miss. Uncover these through:

*Comparison Tasks*:
- Present similar cases with different outcomes
- Ask expert to identify key differences
- Document decision criteria and cues

*Anomaly Detection*:
- Present normal and abnormal cases
- Ask what seems wrong or unusual
- Capture warning signs and red flags

*Prototype Cases*:
- Elicit typical examples of each category
- Identify defining characteristics
- Document variations and edge cases

### Retiring Expert Programs

## Knowledge Elicitation Techniques

### Structured Interviews

Systematic approach to extracting knowledge from experts:

**Preparation Phase**:
- Research the expert's background and area of expertise
- Define learning objectives and key questions
- Review existing documentation and identify gaps
- Schedule adequate time (typically 60-90 minutes)
- Prepare recording/note-taking approach

**Interview Techniques**:

| Technique | When to Use | Example Questions |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Critical Incident** | Understand problem-solving and decision-making | "Tell me about a time when X went wrong. What did you do?" |
| **Scenario-Based** | Elicit conditional knowledge and judgment | "If you encountered Y situation, how would you handle it?" |
| **Process Walkthrough** | Document procedures and workflows | "Walk me through the steps you take to accomplish Z." |
| **Decision Analysis** | Understand decision criteria and trade-offs | "What factors do you consider when deciding between options?" |
| **Problem Exploration** | Identify troubleshooting approaches | "When users report problem X, what do you check first? Why?" |
| **Exception Handling** | Capture edge cases and variations | "What are the unusual cases or exceptions to the normal process?" |

**Follow-up Phase**:
- Document the interview while details are fresh
- Identify gaps or areas needing clarification
- Share draft documentation with the expert for review
- Iterate until accuracy is confirmed

### Cognitive Task Analysis

Detailed method for understanding complex cognitive work:

**Steps in Cognitive Task Analysis**:

1. **Knowledge Audit**: Identify what the expert needs to know and do
2. **Knowledge Elicitation**: Extract knowledge using multiple techniques (observation, interview, scenario analysis)
3. **Knowledge Analysis**: Organize and structure the elicited knowledge
4. **Knowledge Representation**: Document knowledge in usable formats
5. **Knowledge Verification**: Validate with experts and potential users

**Applications**:
- Documenting complex troubleshooting procedures
- Capturing diagnostic expertise
- Creating decision support systems
- Developing training programs for complex skills

### Group Knowledge Capture

Leveraging collective knowledge through facilitated sessions:

**Retrospectives**: Team reflection on what worked, what didn't, and what to improve. Structure using "Start, Stop, Continue" or "Went Well, Needs Improvement, Action Items."

**Knowledge Cafes**: Informal discussion sessions where participants explore topics and share experiences in small groups that rotate between topics.

**World Cafe Method**: Large group conversation process where participants move between tables discussing questions, with ideas building across rounds.

**Delphi Technique**: Structured process using multiple rounds of questionnaires to achieve consensus among experts on complex issues.

**Nominal Group Technique**: Structured brainstorming approach where participants independently generate ideas, then share and prioritize as a group.

## Knowledge Creation

### Converting Implicit Knowledge to Explicit

Many valuable insights exist as implicit knowledge - patterns and understanding that haven't been formally articulated. This conversion is the essence of the SECI model's **Externalization mode**.

**Identification Methods**:
- Analyze frequently asked questions
- Review resolved support tickets and problem records
- Monitor discussion forums and collaboration spaces
- Conduct knowledge gap analysis
- Survey users about documentation needs

**Creation Approaches**:
- Synthesize patterns from multiple sources (tickets, emails, discussions)
- Document tribal knowledge through interviews and observation
- Create visualizations that make patterns and relationships explicit
- Develop decision trees or diagnostic guides from expert judgment
- Build reference materials from scattered information

### Collaborative Knowledge Creation

Leveraging collective intelligence to create comprehensive knowledge assets:

**Wiki-Style Collaboration**:
- Start with a basic structure or outline
- Enable multiple contributors to add and refine content
- Use discussion/comments for questions and coordination
- Implement version control to track changes
- Designate content owners to maintain quality and coherence

**Documentation Sprints**:
- Time-boxed events (typically 1-3 days) focused on creating documentation
- Bring together experts, writers, and users
- Target specific documentation gaps or priorities
- Use templates and style guides for consistency
- Conduct peer review before publishing

**Book Sprints**:
- Intensive 3-5 day events to create comprehensive documentation or guides
- Facilitated process with defined roles (authors, facilitator, technical support)
- Collaborative writing, editing, and illustration
- Produces complete, publication-ready content

---

## Content Quality Standards

### Quality Dimensions

Effective knowledge assets must meet multiple quality criteria:

| Quality Dimension | Description | Assessment Questions |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Accuracy** | Information is correct and factually precise | Is the information correct? Are there errors or inaccuracies? |
| **Completeness** | All necessary information is included | Are there gaps? Is anything missing? Does it answer the full question? |
| **Currency** | Information is up-to-date and relevant | When was this last updated? Is it still accurate? |
| **Clarity** | Content is easy to understand | Can the target audience understand this? Is language clear and unambiguous? |
| **Consistency** | Format and terminology align with standards | Does it follow templates and style guides? Is terminology consistent? |
| **Relevance** | Content addresses real user needs | Does this answer common questions? Is it useful to the target audience? |
| **Findability** | Users can discover the content when needed | Is it properly titled, tagged, and categorized? Will searches find it? |
| **Usability** | Content can be easily applied | Can users follow this successfully? Are steps clear and actionable? |

### Quality Review Process

**Peer Review Approach**:

1. **Author Self-Review**: Creator checks against quality checklist before submission
2. **Technical Review**: Subject matter expert verifies accuracy and completeness
3. **Editorial Review**: Editor checks clarity, consistency, and style compliance
4. **User Testing**: Representative users test procedures and provide feedback
5. **Final Approval**: Content owner approves for publication
6. **Post-Publication Review**: Monitor usage and feedback; update as needed

**Lightweight Review Options**:
- Single reviewer (technical or editorial depending on content type)
- Community review (publish draft, solicit feedback, revise)
- Continuous improvement (publish minimum viable content, improve based on usage)

## Knowledge Capture Strategy

### Prioritization Framework

Not all knowledge is equally valuable to capture. Prioritize based on:

**Value Dimensions**:

| Dimension | High Priority | Low Priority |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Business Impact** | Affects critical operations, revenue, or compliance | Limited operational impact |
| **Reuse Potential** | Needed frequently by many people | Rarely needed or single-use |
| **Knowledge Risk** | Held by few experts, retirement risk | Widely distributed knowledge |
| **Current State** | Not documented, scattered, or outdated | Well documented and current |
| **Effort Required** | Can be captured efficiently | Extremely difficult or time-consuming |
| **Urgency** | Time-sensitive need or deadline | Can be deferred |

**Prioritization Matrix**:

```
High Impact + High Risk = URGENT - Capture immediately
High Impact + Low Risk = IMPORTANT - Schedule capture
Low Impact + High Risk = OPPORTUNISTIC - Capture if easy
Low Impact + Low Risk = DEFERRED - Capture only if time permits
```

### Capture Planning

**Knowledge Capture Project Plan**:

1. **Scope Definition**
   - Identify knowledge domain or topic area
   - Define target audience and their needs
   - Determine success criteria and deliverables

2. **Expert Identification**
   - Identify subject matter experts and stakeholders
   - Assess availability and willingness to participate
   - Plan for backup experts if needed

3. **Method Selection**

## Connection to SECI Model

The knowledge capture and creation practices described in this chapter primarily address the **Externalization** mode of the SECI model - converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. Understanding this connection helps contextualize capture within the broader knowledge conversion cycle.

### Externalization in the SECI Model

**Externalization (Tacit → Explicit)**: The process of articulating tacit knowledge into explicit concepts through:
- Metaphors and analogies that make implicit understanding explicit
- Dialogue and reflection that surface assumptions and insights
- Documentation that codifies expertise and experience
- Models and frameworks that structure intuitive knowledge

**Why Externalization Is Critical**:
- Makes individual expertise available to the organization
- Preserves knowledge that would otherwise be lost
- Enables scaling of expertise across teams and locations
- Creates foundation for organizational learning
- Supports innovation through recombination of explicit knowledge

### Knowledge Capture Methods Mapped to SECI

| Capture Method | SECI Mode | Knowledge Flow |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Expert Interviews** | Externalization | Expert's tacit knowledge → Documented procedures |
| **After-Action Reviews** | Externalization | Team experience → Lessons learned articles |
| **Observation** | Externalization | Expert's tacit practice → Process documentation |
| **Collaboration** | Socialization + Externalization | Shared tacit knowledge → Co-created explicit assets |
| **Documentation Synthesis** | Combination | Multiple explicit sources → Integrated knowledge base |

### Integration with Other SECI Modes

While this chapter focuses on Externalization (capture), effective knowledge management requires all four SECI modes:

**Socialization** (Tacit → Tacit):
- Mentoring and apprenticeship programs
- Communities of practice
- Job shadowing and observation
- Covered in Chapter 11 (Communities)

**Combination** (Explicit → Explicit):
- Organizing and integrating captured knowledge
- Creating knowledge architecture and taxonomy
- Building comprehensive documentation from fragments
- Covered in Chapter 10 (Conversion)

**Internalization** (Explicit → Tacit):
- Using captured knowledge to build individual expertise
- Learning from documentation
- Training and skill development
- Covered in Chapters 12 (Transfer) and 15 (Adoption)

**The Complete Cycle**:
1. **Socialization**: Experts share tacit knowledge through mentoring
2. **Externalization**: Tacit expertise documented (this chapter)
3. **Combination**: Documents organized into knowledge base (Chapter 10)
4. **Internalization**: Others learn from knowledge base, building new tacit knowledge
5. **Cycle repeats**: New expertise shared and captured

### Facilitating Externalization

Effective externalization requires addressing common challenges:

**Tacit Knowledge Is Hard to Articulate**:
- Use structured elicitation techniques (interviews, CTA)
- Employ scenario-based questioning
- Combine observation with verbal explanation
- Use metaphors and analogies
- Create safe environment for imperfect articulation

**Quality Varies Across Contributors**:
- Provide templates and examples
- Offer writing support and editing
- Implement review processes
- Focus on "good enough" not perfection
- Enable iterative improvement

**Time and Motivation Barriers**:
- Integrate capture into workflows
- Provide clear incentives and recognition
- Make capture tools easy to use
- Demonstrate value and impact
- Allocate dedicated time

## Review Questions

Test your understanding of knowledge capture concepts and practices:

1. **Externalization and the SECI Model**:
   Explain how knowledge capture relates to the SECI model's Externalization mode. Why is Externalization critical for organizational knowledge management, and what makes it challenging to achieve effectively?

2. **Capture Method Selection**:
   Your organization has identified a retiring expert with 25 years of experience in a critical technical area. Design a knowledge capture plan that includes: (a) appropriate capture methods, (b) timeline and phases, (c) deliverables to create, and (d) how you would address the expert's concern about being "too busy" to participate extensively.

3. **Overcoming Capture Barriers**:
   An IT support team knows they should document solutions when resolving tickets, but documentation rates are only 15%. Identify at least four potential root causes for this low rate and propose specific, actionable solutions for each cause.

4. **Trigger Design**:
   Design an event-based knowledge capture trigger for project closeouts that would be built into your organization's project management process. Include: (a) what would trigger the capture, (b) what would be captured, (c) who would be involved, (d) what template or structure would be used, and (e) how you would ensure follow-through.

5. **Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs**:
   A knowledge management leader argues for rigorous multi-step review processes before publishing any knowledge article. Another leader argues for "publish fast, improve continuously" approach with minimal review. Analyze the trade-offs of each approach and propose a middle ground that balances quality and speed. Under what circumstances would you favor one approach over the other?

## Key Takeaways

- Knowledge capture must be strategic, focusing on high-value, high-risk knowledge areas rather than attempting to document everything
- Just-in-time capture integrated into existing workflows (after-action reviews, ticket resolution, project closeouts) is more sustainable than separate documentation efforts
- Effective knowledge elicitation requires structured techniques like expert interviews, cognitive task analysis, and facilitated group sessions
- Standardized templates and style guides ensure consistency, completeness, and usability of knowledge assets
- Quality standards and review processes are essential to maintain accuracy, clarity, and relevance of captured knowledge
- Knowledge creation is not just transcription - it involves synthesis, organization, and conversion of implicit patterns into explicit assets through the SECI model's Externalization mode
- Collaborative approaches to knowledge creation leverage collective intelligence and distribute the documentation burden
- Technology tools should facilitate and accelerate knowledge capture, not add overhead or complexity
- Prioritization frameworks help focus limited resources on the knowledge that provides the greatest organizational value
- Successful knowledge capture requires addressing both the technical aspects (methods, tools, standards) and the human aspects (motivation, time, skills)
- Event-based, scheduled, and demand-driven triggers ensure knowledge is captured at optimal moments
- Expert knowledge transfer requires structured approaches including assessment, capture, transfer, and validation phases
- Overcoming capture barriers requires understanding root causes and implementing targeted solutions for time, motivation, skills, and tool issues
- Effective incentive structures combine recognition, career development, and integration with performance management

## Summary

Knowledge capture and creation are foundational capabilities for any knowledge management program. This chapter has explored the methods, techniques, and practices that enable organizations to systematically capture valuable knowledge and create high-quality knowledge assets.

Effective knowledge capture requires a strategic approach that prioritizes high-value knowledge, integrates capture activities into existing workflows, provides standardized templates and tools, and establishes quality standards. Organizations must choose appropriate elicitation techniques based on the type of knowledge being captured, from structured interviews and cognitive task analysis to group facilitation methods and crowdsourcing approaches.

Creating usable knowledge assets requires more than transcription. It involves converting tacit and implicit knowledge into explicit documentation through the SECI model's Externalization mode, writing clearly and user-focused content, and organizing information in ways that support effective discovery and use. Quality standards and review processes ensure that captured knowledge is accurate, complete, current, and usable.

Timing matters significantly - implementing event-based, scheduled, and demand-driven triggers ensures knowledge is captured when it has maximum value and freshness. Expert knowledge transfer, particularly for retiring experts, requires structured multi-phase approaches that balance capture efficiency with thoroughness.

Success in knowledge capture depends on addressing both technical and human factors. While tools and techniques are important, overcoming barriers related to time, motivation, skills, and tool complexity determines whether knowledge capture becomes a sustainable practice. Effective incentive structures that include recognition, career development, and performance integration drive long-term engagement.

Organizations that integrate knowledge capture into standard work processes, recognize and reward contributions, provide the necessary support and training, and continuously improve based on usage and feedback will build valuable knowledge assets that enhance organizational capability and performance.

The next chapter explores the full spectrum of knowledge conversion techniques through the SECI model, examining how knowledge flows between tacit and explicit forms to create organizational learning and innovation.
