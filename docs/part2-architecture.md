# Part II: Knowledge Architecture

Design the structural foundation for organizing, managing, and accessing organizational knowledge.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

## Overview

Part II focuses on the technical and organizational architecture that enables effective knowledge management. These chapters cover how to structure knowledge, manage its lifecycle, implement systems to support knowledge work, and establish repositories that meet organizational needs.

## Chapters in This Part

| Chapter | Title | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 5 | [Knowledge Architecture and Taxonomy](/KnowledgeManagementHandbook/chapters/05-architecture/) | Design principles, classification schemes, metadata standards |
| 6 | [Knowledge Lifecycle Management](/KnowledgeManagementHandbook/chapters/06-lifecycle/) | Lifecycle phases and processes from creation to retirement |
| 7 | [Service Knowledge Management System](/KnowledgeManagementHandbook/chapters/07-skms/) | ITIL SKMS concept, layers, and integration with CMDB |
| 8 | [Knowledge Repositories and Systems](/KnowledgeManagementHandbook/chapters/08-repositories/) | Repository types, design principles, and search capabilities |

## Key Learning Outcomes

After completing Part II, you will be able to:

- Design a knowledge architecture that supports organizational needs
- Develop taxonomies and classification schemes for knowledge organization
- Manage knowledge through its complete lifecycle
- Implement the ITIL Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS)
- Select and configure appropriate knowledge repositories
- Design effective search and discovery mechanisms

## Architecture Principles

### The Foundation of Effective KM

A well-designed knowledge architecture enables:

1. **Findability** - Users can quickly locate relevant knowledge
2. **Consistency** - Knowledge is organized uniformly across domains
3. **Scalability** - Structure supports growth and evolution
4. **Integration** - Systems connect to form a coherent ecosystem
5. **Usability** - Intuitive navigation and access patterns

### Core Architecture Tenets

| Tenet | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| User-Centered Design | Architecture serves the needs of knowledge consumers |
| Simplicity Over Complexity | Keep it as simple as possible, but no simpler |
| Flexibility and Adaptability | Enable evolution as needs change |
| Standards-Based | Leverage established standards and practices |
| Lifecycle Thinking | Design for the full knowledge lifecycle |
