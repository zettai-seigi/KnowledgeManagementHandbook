## Key Framework Elements

### Knowledge Types (DIKW Hierarchy)

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Data** | Raw facts without context | Server CPU: 85% |
| **Information** | Data with context and meaning | Server CPU high during backup window |
| **Knowledge** | Information with experience applied | Backup jobs cause CPU spikes; schedule off-peak |
| **Wisdom** | Knowledge applied with judgment | Architect systems to isolate backup impact |

### Knowledge Categories

| Category | Description | Characteristics |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Tacit** | Personal, experiential knowledge | Hard to articulate, context-dependent |
| **Explicit** | Documented, codified knowledge | Easy to share, transferable |
| **Implicit** | Undocumented but articulable | Can be captured with effort |
| **Embedded** | Built into processes/systems | Institutional, often invisible |

### 8 Critical Success Factors

| # | Success Factor | Category |
|---|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Executive Sponsorship and Vision | Leadership |
| 2 | Knowledge-Sharing Culture | Culture |
| 3 | Clear Governance and Ownership | Governance |
| 4 | Quality Content and Curation | Content |
| 5 | Intuitive Tools and Systems | Technology |
| 6 | Integration with Work Processes | Process |
| 7 | Recognition and Incentives | People |
| 8 | Continuous Measurement and Improvement | Metrics |

### 6 Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Target | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Knowledge Article Usage Rate | ≥70% | % of incidents using knowledge |
| First Contact Resolution (FCR) | ≥75% | Issues resolved on first contact |
| Article Quality Score | ≥4.0/5.0 | User ratings of article helpfulness |
| Knowledge Contribution Rate | ≥80% | % of staff contributing knowledge |
| Search Success Rate | ≥85% | Searches finding relevant results |
| Time to Resolution Improvement | ≥30% | Reduction from knowledge use |

## The SECI Model

The foundational framework for knowledge creation and conversion:

| Mode | From → To | Description | Example |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Socialization** | Tacit → Tacit | Sharing through experience | Mentoring, observation |
| **Externalization** | Tacit → Explicit | Articulating tacit knowledge | Documentation, videos |
| **Combination** | Explicit → Explicit | Systemizing explicit knowledge | Reports, databases |
| **Internalization** | Explicit → Tacit | Learning by doing | Training, practice |

## Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS)

For ITSM environments, this handbook covers the KCS methodology:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Abundance** | Create content as a by-product of solving problems |
| **Create Value** | Knowledge is valuable when it helps others |
| **Demand Driven** | Capture knowledge based on actual demand |
| **Trust** | Contributors are trusted knowledge workers |

### KCS Double Loop Process

| Loop | Focus | Activities |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Solve Loop** | Individual incident | Capture, structure, reuse |
| **Evolve Loop** | Content health | Review, improve, archive |
